# Budget Spreadsheet
1. Enter budget categories in column A
2. Enter monthly amounts in column B
3. Enter all expenses in the table on the right, with categories in column H matching the categories of the Monthly Budget table.

Expense items will be sorted by date as entered. These expenses will be automatically subtracted from the corresponsing budget category. The table then tracks remaining budgets for each category and the budget totals. More rows can be inserted above the 'Total' row, and cell formatting can then be copied from other cells.
